<h2>ðŸš€ About Me</h2> 
<a>My name is Rashid, and I am an IT student at RTU MIREA. I like solving complex problems and creating something new, so I chose programming. I am passionate about developing in C++, Python, HTML and CSS, and I always strive to learn something new. I like to apply my skills to solve real problems and create useful products. I'm always open to new projects and ideas, and I'm looking forward to putting my skills into practice.</a>
